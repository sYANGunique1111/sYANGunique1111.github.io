I am a Joint PhD student on Human Pose Estimation (HPE) at CYU and VUB-ETRO. I gained my master degree at Ã‰cole Centrale de Nantes, then worked as a Computer Vision (CV) algorithm engineer for Luokung Tech, China. As an experienced programmer in Deep Leanring, I am familiar with frameworks of Pytorch and Tensorflow, and Python language.
